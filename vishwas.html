        <h1>Now on to some mountain-specific quotes! “Never measure the height of a mountain until you reach the top. Then you will see how low it was.” “Somewhere between the bottom of the climb and the summit is the answer to the mystery why we climb.”</h1>

    <p>“The mountains are calling, and I must go.” John Muir perfectly sums up our feelings about these majestic natural wonders. Mountains have always been a source of awe and beauty, and sometimes we don't have the words to capture how much we admire them. Nature quotes can help put into words how much exhilarating it is to look at mountains, climb and hike mountains, ski mountains—and even how much we enjoy them as a powerful metaphor for hard work, exploration, and victory in literature, art, and music. ("Climb Every Mountain" from The Sound of Music, anyone?)

        For our money, nothing beats the feeling of reaching the summit of a mountain and looking down on the world below. But during those times when you’re stuck at home instead of exploring a beautiful blue peak, explore these inspirational hiking quotes and camping quotes to help transport you to your own mental mountaintop. Now on to some mountain-specific quotes!</p>
